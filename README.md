This repository contains installer scripts for a few useful applications regarding linux desktop environments (with high DPI monitor support) and servers for supporting data engineering work, machine learning and data science tasks while keeping the system relatively bloatware free.

**Notes:**
- Scripts were tested on a base-packages-installed-only (without any desktop) Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 LTS - Bionic Beaver - AMD64.
- This linux distribution is chosen for basis due to its long term support, large community, large PPA repository and native linux NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit availability.
- Desktop environment installer script covers a few desktop environments where high DPI monitors are well supported but there is no Ubuntu flavour or PPA is needed.
